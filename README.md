# EvenCounter

An example project for the [Agdalache](https://github.com/viktorcsimma/agdalache) project, containing an integer counter that is proven in Agda to contain only even numbers. Concrete values can be added from the GUI, and another button increases the counter with 2 every second, for five seconds, in an interruptible way. Used for demonstrating capabilities of the SDK and futures.

A binary for Windows is available under Releases.
